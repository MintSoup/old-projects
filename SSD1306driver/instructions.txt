How to use the library
1) copy the ssd1306 files to your project
2) inside the ssd1306.h file, select your correct STM32 series with a #define, make sure the selected I2C port is correct
3) #include "ssd1306.h"
4) ssd1306_Init(), to init the display
5) use the ssd1306_xxxxxxx functions to draw on the framebuffer
6) ssd1306_Update();

Note: Library assumes the I2C port is correctly set up before calling ssd1306_Init().


To use images - 
1) Get a bitmap image (.bmp file format), make it black and white only. Make sure the color depth is set to 1 bit.
2) Use image2cpp.html to convert the image to a C array (https://javl.github.io/image2cpp/ online version)
	a) Import the BMP file
	b) Select the correct image settings
	c) In the output section, make sure the output format is set top "plain bytes" and the draw mode to vertical 1bit/pixel
	d) Click generate code, copy the text into a C array
3) Use the Image struct along with the ssd1306_DrawImage function to draw the image onto the framebuffer
	a) If the image seems messed up, make sure the output was set to vertical in image2cpp. Recreate the C array if needed.
